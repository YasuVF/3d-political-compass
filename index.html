  <h1>3D Political Compass Test</h1>
  <p>This test was created to map political ideology using a three-dimensional model and accurate ideology interpretations, offering a deeper and more nuanced view than traditional left-right or authoritarian-libertarian charts. Due to the nature of 3D modeling, references to 'up' and 'down' become difficult, so take them as general guides and examine the results carefully. Your answers will place you along three axes:</p>
<p>The original Political Compass — while widely used — suffers from oversimplification and misinformed framing. It reduces complex ideological tendencies to two axes without accounting for depth of belief or moral foundations. For instance, moral absolutism vs relativism is a meaningful third axis that is entirely absent. Additionally, the original test tends to reflect contemporary Western political narratives and may misplace certain ideologies when viewed historically or cross-culturally. For example, Adolf Hitler is frequently placed on the far-right of the traditional 2D compass, yet his regime combined economically socialist policies, extreme nationalism, and moral absolutism rooted in a dogmatic worldview — making him more accurately categorized as an adherence socialist: authoritarian, principled, and left-leaning in terms of economic control. Within this 3D model, he would likely sit closer to the center of the Adherence Socialism quadrant — far from the libertarian or capitalist corners his 2D placement suggests.</p>
<p>Another key limitation of older models is their treatment of political labels as fixed points. In reality, ideologies evolve and adapt across time and cultures. What is considered "left" or "right" in one country or century may flip entirely in another. For example, early 20th-century progressives in the United States supported ideas like eugenics and prohibition — policies that would not align with today’s progressive values. This fluidity underscores the need for a model that emphasizes underlying philosophical structures — such as power, moral conviction, and economic control — rather than relying solely on terms that shift with the political climate.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Economic (X-axis)</strong>: Left (Socialist) ↔ Right (Capitalist)</li>
  <li><strong>Authority (Y-axis)</strong>: Down (Reformist) ↔ Up (Traditionalist)</li>
  <li><strong>Adherence (Z-axis)</strong>: Forward (Relativistic) ↔ Back (Principled)</li>
</ul>
<p>Answer each question honestly. There are no right or wrong responses — only insights.</p>
